Welcome To SQLmentor.
I made this tool because when I first started I had heard a lot about SQLmap and people using it but didn't really understand
how to use it.

I started doing some actual research on how to use SQLmap and decided to make a tool to help others that do not really
understand how to use it. Users will also have to learn how to read code, it will help them a lot in the future so some
day they will hopefully be able to write their own tools and help others learn.

HOW TO USE SQLMENTOR
===========================
Before Using The Tool And Any Of Its Options, Go Into The Code By Typing "nano sqlmentor.sh" in the terminal.
Look through the code until you see a note that says the following:

Do Not Forget To Replace The Default Domains

You Will Need To Do That Each Time, As You Would If You Were Using SQLmap By Itself.


HOW TO TELL IF IT WORKS
===========================
Telling if sql injection works on the website is easy, you will see actual results LOL
SQLmap also tells you if the site is injectable or not, so it is rather easy.


CLOSING NOTES
================
Much Love To Each And Every One Of You. I Hope You Have A Fantastic Day And That My Program Proves Useful To You
In Your Pursuit Of Knowledge.

Hack The Planet!!!
